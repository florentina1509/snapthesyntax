# Memory Card Game

This is a simple browser-based memory game where players flip cards to find matching pairs. I chose this game because it allows me to practice DOM manipulation, JavaScript logic, and responsive layout using Flexbox. The goal is to match all pairs in the fewest number of moves before the game restarts.

## Getting Started

**Play the game here:** [Live Game Link](https://florentina1509.github.io/snapthesyntax/)

### How to Play
1. Cards will be revealed fro 2 seconds before they are flipped back. 
2. Click on a card to flip it.
3. Try to find the matching pair.
4. Match all pairs to win the game.
